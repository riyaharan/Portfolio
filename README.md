### Data Analysis Projects
4. **CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis (Python)(https://github.com/riyaharan/CO2-Greenhouse-Gas-emissions/blob/main/CO2_GreenhouseGas_EDA.ipynb)**
- Techniques: Data Analysis, Visualisation
- Description: Analysed the impact of fossil fuel usage on CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases. Contributed to the understanding of climate change through comprehensive data analysis.

### Deep Learning
5. **Measuring non-verbal synchrony from mother-infant interactions from videos (Ongoing research, will be published end of September, 2023 in Springer)**
- Techniques: GRU Models, Transfer Learning, Autoencoders, Euclidean distance calculations and correlation analysis
- Description: This project focuses on assessing mother-child interactions to understand early child development. It employs a GRU machine learning model and Monte Carlo Validation for classifying interaction quality. Movement coordinate preprocessing and dimensionality reduction using autoencoders are performed. Euclidean distances and correlation analysis uncover interaction characteristics. Transfer learning with pre-trained GRU layers enhances predictions, achieving a mean AUC of 0.788. This approach effectively captures interaction dynamics, enabling accurate classification of good or poor caregiving interactions with 78.8% accuracy.

### Data Visualisation Projects
6. **Music Taste and Mental Health Correlation Analysis (Python)(https://github.com/riyaharan/MusicEffectsxMentalHealth/blob/main/Music_MentalHealth_RH.ipynb)**
- Techniques: Data Analysis, Visualisation
- Description: Explored the connections between individuals' music preferences and self-reported mental health. This project aims to provide insights that could contribute to more informed applications of Music therapy.
